# UX Builder — What We're Building (and Why)

## The 30-second pitch

A web app that helps you turn one sentence — *"I want to build a todo app"* — into something you can click through in a browser, before writing a line of real code.

Not a code generator. Not a no-code platform. A **product-definition tool** that argues with you about what you're actually trying to build, then renders it as a static HTML prototype so the conversation can move from words to screens.

For this iteration we're shipping the front half of the journey:

```
Idea  →  Project Contract  →  Workflows  →  Screens  →  Clickable Wireframe
                                                              │
                                                              ▼
                          (Test suite + automation come in the next iteration)
```

By the end of this doc you'll know:
- What the user actually does, step by step
- What artifacts they produce and what each one looks like
- How the system handles real-world messiness (questions vs. change requests, scope drift, mid-stream feedback)

We'll use a single example throughout: **building a todo app**. We'll cover the happy path and four kinds of detour.

---

## The four artifacts

Each step produces a thing the user can read, share, and (eventually) click. Each one is a separate file, persisted, versioned, and reviewable on its own.

### 1. Project Contract — the "what"
Markdown. Four fixed sections:
- **Goal Statement** — one paragraph, what the product does and the problem it solves
- **Personas** — the people who use it, what they do
- **Entity Map** — the things the product knows about (Task, User, Tag, …)
- **Boundaries** — explicit *we are NOT building this*

This is the constitution for everything that follows. It's locked once Phase 1 ends — every later change is checked against it.

### 2. Workflow Map — the "how"
Markdown. One section per workflow. A workflow is one persona doing one thing end-to-end (e.g. *"Individual User creates a task"*). Each workflow lists pre-conditions, steps, exit criteria, edge cases.

### 3. Screen Inventory — the "where"
Markdown. One section per screen. Each screen lists its purpose, what it shows, and which other screens you can navigate to from it. The collection of screens forms a navigable graph.

### 4. Wireframe — the "let me click it"
A folder of static HTML files: `index.html` (a shell with navigation), one `<screen-id>.html` per screen, a `data.js` with realistic dummy content. Loads in a sandboxed iframe in the app. Crude visually, but you can click between screens, see realistic content, and tell whether the structure feels right.

---

## The user journey (with todo app)

We'll walk through every step. At each step you'll see what the user types, what the system does, and what shows up on screen. After the happy path we revisit the spots where things branch.

---

### Step 1 — Open the app, type a sentence

The user opens `http://localhost:3000`. Empty sidebar, empty document panel. They type into the chat:

> *I want to build a simple todo app*

…and hit Enter.

**What happens behind the scenes:**

- A session is created. It gets a UUID and a placeholder title.
- Two LLM calls fire in parallel:
  - A *title* call — short, returns "Personal Task Tracker" or similar; updates the session title in the sidebar
  - A *goal expansion* call — the long one. The model takes the user's sentence and produces a complete first draft of the contract (filling gaps with its best judgment)

**What the user sees:**

- The user's message appears as a blue bubble on the right
- A new session "Personal Task Tracker" appears in the sidebar
- The assistant streams a one-sentence reply: *"Drafted a contract for a personal task tracker."*
- The right panel populates with a Project Contract:

```
## Goal Statement
A lightweight personal task management app that helps individuals
capture, organize, and track tasks across their day.

## Personas
**Individual User** — A single person managing their own to-do list.
Interaction type: Creates, edits, completes tasks; organizes them
into lists; sets due dates and reminders.

## Entity Map
**Task** — A single actionable item with title, optional description,
due date, status. Individual User creates, edits, marks complete.
**List** — A grouping of related tasks (e.g. "Work", "Home").
Individual User creates, renames, archives, reorders.

## Boundaries
- No team / multi-user features
- No calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- No advanced project management (Gantt charts, dependencies)
- No time tracking or billing
```

A `v1` badge sits in the corner of the document panel.

> **Why is the system being so opinionated?** Because indecision early kills momentum. The model fills in obvious gaps so the user has something concrete to react to. It's much easier to say "no, take that out" than to start from a blank page.

---

### Step 2 — The user asks a question

The user is curious about the model's choices. They type:

> *Why didn't you include reminders as a separate entity?*

**What happens:**

The system runs a Phase 1 conversation call. The prompt is structured so the model picks one of three response modes:

1. **First-message mode** — emit a complete contract (Step 1)
2. **Edit mode** — emit an updated contract surgically preserving everything else
3. **Question / chat mode** — answer in plain prose, **don't touch the contract**

A question triggers Mode 3.

**What the user sees:**

- An assistant message: *"I treated reminders as a property of a Task (a `due date` field plus a notification preference) rather than a standalone entity, since each reminder belongs to exactly one task. If you'd like reminders to have their own lifecycle — independent rules, recurrence, etc. — I can promote them to a separate Entity."*
- The document panel does **not** change. Still `v1`.

This is critical. A question is not a change request. The model has to know the difference.

---

### Step 3 — The user requests a small change

> *Add tags so I can categorize tasks across lists*

**What happens:**

This is Mode 2 — a targeted edit. The prompt tells the model: preserve every existing persona, entity, and boundary verbatim; touch only what the user asked about; cross-update related fields (here, the Task entity gets a `tags` field and the Individual User gains an interaction with the new Tag entity).

**What the user sees:**

- Assistant message: *"Added a Tag entity."*
- Document panel: `v2` badge. Diff (mental): Goal unchanged, Individual User unchanged but with one new line about tagging tasks, Task entity unchanged but with `+ tags` mention, **new Tag entity** appears, Boundaries unchanged.

> **Why does the diff matter?** Because if the model rewrites the entire contract every turn, the user can't trust that earlier decisions are still in force. Surgical edits are how trust accumulates.

---

### Step 4 — The user requests something out of scope

> *Add team collaboration so my coworkers can share lists with me*

This conflicts with the boundary *"No team / multi-user features"*. Two possible outcomes:

**Outcome A** — The model honors the boundary and pushes back:

> *That conflicts with the boundary "No team / multi-user features." Want me to remove the boundary and add team support, or keep the app personal-only?*

No contract update. User decides.

**Outcome B** — The model overrides the boundary and emits an updated contract with a Team Member persona. (This is technically wrong; the prompt tries to prevent it.)

If (B) happens, the user sees the change immediately in the document panel and can say *"Undo that, I want to keep it personal-only"* — Mode 2 reverts.

> The system tries to make (A) the default. Real-world testing will tell us how often (B) leaks through; the prompt is the lever.

---

### Step 5 — Click "Done — Validate & Complete Phase 1"

The user is satisfied. They click the green Done button.

**What happens:**

A separate validation LLM call runs — different prompt, different model role. It checks the contract against an internal checklist:

- Every section populated?
- Every persona referenced by at least one entity interaction?
- Goal vs. boundaries internally consistent (no contradictions)?
- Personas distinct from each other (no near-duplicates)?

Returns either `STATUS: PASS` or `STATUS: FAIL` with a list of issues and suggestions.

**Two paths:**

**Path A — FAIL.** The chat shows an amber system message:

> ```
> STATUS: FAIL
>
> Issues:
> - Tag entity has no defined interaction with Individual User
> - Goal mentions reminders but no entity covers them
>
> Suggestions:
> - Add an "Individual User can create and apply Tag" interaction
> - Either drop reminders from the goal or promote them to an entity
> ```

The Done button is re-enabled. Phase indicator stays on Phase 1. The user can fix the issues with more chat messages and click Done again.

**Path B — PASS.** The phase indicator's Phase 1 chip flips to green ✓. **Without any further user action,** the system automatically starts Phase 2 Stage 1.

> **Why no extra click?** Because waiting for the user to click "next" twice is just friction. Phase 1 PASS is consent.

---

### Step 6 — Phase 2 Stage 1: Design (Workflow Map + Screen Inventory)

The phase indicator now shows a row of sub-stage chips:

```
Phase 1 ✓   →   Phase 2:  [Design ●pulsing]  ›  Wireframe  ›  Test Suite  ›  Automation
```

The Design chip pulses blue while it's running. This stage runs ~7 LLM calls in a small DAG:

1. **Workflow discovery** — given the contract, list every workflow
2. **Workflow detail** (batched, one call per workflow) — flesh each one out
3. **Workflow Map formatting** — render the markdown document
4. **Screen extraction** — given the workflow map, derive the screens needed
5. **Navigation validation** — does the screen graph cover every workflow?
6. **(Conditional) Screen correction** — only runs if (5) found gaps
7. **Screen Inventory formatting** — render the markdown document

System messages appear in the chat as each step completes (*"Workflow Map generated"* etc.). When the stage finishes, the phase indicator shows:

```
Phase 1 ✓   →   Design [amber·review]  ›  Wireframe  ›  Test Suite  ›  Automation
```

…and a banner appears between the chat and the input:

> **Design stage complete**
> Review the Workflow Map and Screen Inventory in the document panel.
> When ready, continue to the next stage — or type feedback in the chat and we'll revise.
>
> [ **Approve → Generate Wireframe** ]

The document panel now has two new tabs (**Workflow Map**, **Screen Inventory**) plus the original Project Contract.

For our todo app, the Workflow Map might list:

- *Capture a task* — Individual User opens the app, taps "+", types a title, optionally sets due date and tags, saves
- *Browse tasks* — Individual User opens the list view, filters by tag or due date, scrolls
- *Mark a task complete* — Individual User taps the checkbox, task moves to a "done" state
- *Edit a task* — Individual User taps a task, modifies fields, saves
- *Manage lists* — Individual User creates, renames, deletes lists
- *Manage tags* — Individual User creates, deletes, recolors tags
- *Archive completed tasks* — Individual User triggers a cleanup action

…and the Screen Inventory might show:

- `home` — Today view, tasks due today
- `list-detail` — All tasks in a chosen list
- `task-create` — Modal/screen for entering a new task
- `task-detail` — View / edit one task
- `tag-manager` — Manage tags
- `settings` — Preferences

Each screen entry has a `nav:` field listing where the user can go from there.

---

### Step 7 — User feedback during the Design review

This is the most interesting step because it has multiple branches. The user has the Approve button right there, but they don't have to click it. They can chat instead.

#### 7a — Approve as-is

User clicks **Approve → Generate Wireframe**. Stage 2 starts. (Skip to Step 8.)

#### 7b — Small change to a workflow

User types:

> *Add an "undo last action" workflow*

The system runs a *Phase 2 conversational* call. The model produces a visible response *plus* a hidden `<change_context>` block describing the requested change:

```
scope: workflow_change
description: Add an undo workflow for the most recent action
```

The system then runs a **drift check** — a separate LLM call that compares the requested change against the locked Project Contract:

- **COMPATIBLE** — the change fits the existing personas/entities/boundaries
- **FLAG** — the change is borderline; user should know
- **DRIFT** — the change requires modifying the contract; must rollback first

For "add undo", the result is COMPATIBLE. The cascade then runs the relevant updates:

- Workflow Map: a new "Undo last action" workflow is appended
- Screen Inventory: re-checked — does it need a new screen for the undo affordance? Probably not (a button on existing screens), so the inventory is unchanged
- Project Contract: untouched (the change didn't introduce new personas/entities/boundaries)

The Approve button remains available; the user can review the updated docs and approve, or iterate further.

#### 7c — Change that affects screens

User types:

> *I want a separate "Today" view that's different from the list views*

`change_context.scope` is `screen_only` here. The system updates the Screen Inventory to add a `today` screen distinct from `home`, updates the navigation graph, and re-renders the Screen Inventory document. Workflow Map is unchanged. Project Contract is unchanged.

#### 7d — User asks for something that drifts

User types:

> *Add support for sharing tasks with my partner*

This conflicts with the contract boundary "No team / multi-user features." The drift check returns:

```
classification: DRIFT
type: NEW_PERSONA
reason: Sharing requires a second user role, which contradicts the
        "No team / multi-user features" boundary in the Project Contract.
```

The chat shows a **red banner**:

> ⛔ **Change Blocked — Contract Drift**
> Sharing requires a second user role, which contradicts the "No team / multi-user features" boundary in the Project Contract.
>
> [ **Go back to Phase 1** ]

The chat input is locked. The only action available is to roll back to Phase 1, edit the contract (e.g. add a Partner persona, remove the boundary), then re-enter Phase 2.

This is by design. We don't want the model to silently broaden scope — that's how products end up sprawling.

#### 7e — Borderline change (FLAG)

User types:

> *Should tasks support sub-tasks?*

The drift check returns:

```
classification: FLAG
type: SCOPE_EXPANSION
reason: Sub-tasks would either require a new entity (Subtask) or
        recursive Task self-reference. Either is a meaningful scope expansion.
```

The chat shows a **yellow banner**:

> ⚠ **Warning — Possible Drift**
> Sub-tasks would either require a new entity (Subtask) or recursive Task self-reference. Either is a meaningful scope expansion.
>
> [ **Continue anyway** ]   [ **Go back to Phase 1** ]

If the user continues, the cascade runs as a `screen_only` or `workflow_change` (the model's call). If they go back to Phase 1, they can amend the contract first.

---

### Step 8 — Stage 2: Wireframe

The user has approved the design. The Wireframe chip pulses. Phase 2 Stage 2 runs:

1. **Dummy data generation** — given the entities, produce realistic JSON content (sample tasks, lists, tags, with names like "Buy groceries" and "Finish the deck for Tuesday's meeting")
2. **Wireframe shell** — generate the `index.html` that holds the navigation
3. **Per-screen HTML** (batched, one call per screen) — generate static HTML for each screen, populated from the dummy data
4. **Smoke test** (code-only, no LLM) — verify every screen ID in the inventory has a matching HTML file and every nav link points somewhere
5. **Data file assembly** (code-only) — turn the dummy JSON into `window.DATA = {...}` for the screens to read

When done, the document panel gets a **Wireframe** tab. Clicking it loads the HTML inside a sandboxed iframe.

The user sees a crude but functional todo app:
- Tap "+ New Task" → goes to `task-create`
- Type a title, hit save → returns to `home`, new task appears in the list
- Tap a task → goes to `task-detail`
- Etc.

Visual fidelity is intentionally low (think wireframes, not Figma mockups). The point is to verify whether the **structure** feels right — the right screens exist, the right nav paths are there, the right content is on each screen.

---

### Step 9 — User feedback on the wireframe

Same branching as Step 7 — the user can approve or revise. Three illustrative cases:

#### 9a — Cosmetic content tweak

> *The example task names are too long, make them feel more like real one-line todos*

`scope: data_only`. Only `data.js` is regenerated. The screen HTML files are unchanged. Reload the wireframe and the new dummy content shows up. The Workflow Map, Screen Inventory, and Project Contract are unchanged.

#### 9b — A screen needs work

> *The task-detail screen is missing the "Mark complete" button*

`scope: screen_only`, target: `task-detail`. Only that one screen's HTML is regenerated. Other screens unchanged. Documents unchanged.

#### 9c — Missing a screen entirely

> *I'm missing a screen for managing recurring tasks*

This is the case you specifically mentioned. The system can't fix this at the wireframe layer because the screen doesn't exist in the inventory and the underlying workflow doesn't exist either. The right thing is to walk back through the stages:

- The drift check first decides if the change fits the contract (recurring tasks — probably COMPATIBLE; the contract didn't say anything about recurrence)
- The cascade scope is `workflow_change` — needs design re-work
- The system rewinds to the Design stage internally:
  - Workflow Map gets a new "Manage recurring tasks" workflow
  - Screen Inventory gets a new `recurrence-settings` screen (with nav links updated)
  - User is shown the updated design and asked to approve
- After approval, the Wireframe stage re-runs incrementally: existing screens unchanged, new screen HTML generated, data.js refreshed

> **Today's note:** this rewind-and-cascade behavior across stages is partially built but not fully wired up. The current code handles `data_only` and `screen_only` cleanly but needs more work for the "rewind to Design, get approval, then cascade forward" flow. It's the first thing to finish in the next iteration.

#### 9d — Something that drifts

Same red-banner / yellow-banner flow as Step 7d / 7e. The contract is the source of truth no matter what stage you're in.

---

### Step 10 — Wireframe approved

The user clicks **Approve → Generate Test Suite**.

**For this iteration of the product, the journey ends here.**

The system would normally continue to Stage 3 (Test Suite — human-readable test cases) and Stage 4 (Automated Tests — executable bundle), but those stages are out of scope for the version we're shipping now. The Approve button at the wireframe stage simply marks the wireframe complete and lets the user export everything they've produced so far.

What they have on disk:
- `project-contract.md` — the locked contract
- `workflow-map.md` — every workflow
- `screen-inventory.md` — every screen with navigation
- A folder of HTML files they can host anywhere as a clickable demo

That's enough to:
- Hand to a designer for high-fidelity mockups
- Hand to engineers as an unambiguous spec
- Show a stakeholder *"this is what we're building"* and get a real reaction
- Save and come back to next week

---

## A note on rollback

Any DRIFT (Step 7d / 9d) gives the user a one-click rollback to Phase 1. What that does:

- Phase 2 is suspended (state preserved on disk)
- Phase 1 reopens with the original chat history
- The user edits the contract (typically: add the persona/entity/boundary that's needed)
- They click Done again
- The system compares the new contract to the snapshot it kept from the original Phase 1 completion:
  - If the contract is structurally identical — the suspended Phase 2 is **restored** as-is (no waiting)
  - If it differs — Phase 2 is **regenerated from scratch** because the design and wireframes might no longer be valid

This means rollback isn't a destructive action; it's a "let me amend the foundation" action.

---

## The build philosophy (in one breath)

This thing is built as **independent modules**. Each one has a narrow job and a small public surface. They form a clean dependency graph (nothing calls "up" the chain) so you can swap one out without touching the others.

You don't need to know all 14 modules to use the app. But knowing they exist explains why certain things are easy:

- **Switching LLM providers** is one module's job (LLM Provider) — not a refactor
- **Storing data** is one module's job (Storage) — file-based today, swap for a database without touching anything else
- **Each LLM call** has a parser paired with it (Parsers + Operation Executor) — when the model misbehaves, fix one prompt or one parser, not the whole pipeline
- **The 4 Phase 2 stages** each have their own runner (in Session Manager) — adding a 5th stage is a contained change

The full module catalog and inter-module contracts live in `replicate-instructions.md`. You don't need it to use the product, but if you ever want to rebuild the system or hack on it, that's the map.

---

## What's deferred to the next iteration

We're shipping the front half of the journey. Explicitly **not** in this version:

| Feature | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Test Suite generation (Stage 3) | The contract → wireframe loop is the riskiest part; ship it and learn before adding more LLM-heavy stages |
| Automated Tests (Stage 4) | Same. Also depends on Test Suite. |
| Full stage-rewind-cascade on feedback (case 9c) | The plumbing is mostly there; needs the cross-stage approval UX completed |
| Multi-user / team accounts | This is a single-developer / single-stakeholder tool right now |
| Provider switching from the UI | Currently `.env.local`; planned as Module 14 ("LLM Configuration") in the next iteration |
| Visual polish on wireframes | Intentionally crude — we're testing structure, not aesthetics |

The stages we ARE shipping (Project Contract → Workflow Map → Screen Inventory → Wireframe) cover the most expensive part of any product project: **getting the scope right** and **seeing it concretely** before anyone writes code.

---

## TL;DR for someone joining the project

1. The product helps users go from one sentence to a clickable wireframe of the product they want to build.
2. The user produces four artifacts in order: **Contract → Workflows → Screens → Wireframe**, with an explicit approval gate after each.
3. The user can chat with the system at any point. The system distinguishes **questions** (chat reply, no doc change) from **change requests** (surgical edit, doc updated).
4. Every change request is checked against the locked contract. **Compatible** → proceeds. **Flag** → user decides. **Drift** → blocked, must rollback.
5. The whole thing is composed of small independent modules — see `replicate-instructions.md` for the full catalog.
6. Test suite + automation are next iteration. This iteration ends at the approved wireframe.

Open the app, type *"I want to build a todo app,"* and see how far you get in 15 minutes.
